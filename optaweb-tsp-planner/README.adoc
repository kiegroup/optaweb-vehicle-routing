= OptaWeb Vehicle Routing Backend

- Maintains and persists user data created through the UI (e.g. visit locations).
- Uses 3rd party services to obtain travel distances between locations based on
  real-world geographical data.
- Uses OptaPlanner to optimize the route between locations.
- Provides network endpoints for interaction with the web UI.

== Project Structure

=== Root Package

The root package name is identical to the Maven Group ID of the project
(`org.optaweb.vehiclerouting`).
It contains a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`,
which enables Spring auto-configuration and component scanning in sub-packages.

=== Domain Package

Contains "business objects" that model the domain of this project,
for example Customer, Depot, Location, Vehicle.
These objects are strictly business-oriented and must not be influenced
by any tools and frameworks (e.g. ORM, marshalling formats etc.).

=== Services Package

Contains classes that implement "use cases".
A use case is for example adding new location, changing vehicle capacity
or finding coordinates for an address.
The business rules that govern use cases are expressed using the domain objects.

Use cases often need to interact with outer layers, such as persistence, web and
optimization.
To keep the code loosely coupled, the interaction with the outer layers
is expressed in terms of interfaces.
Their implementations are provided by Spring IoC container at runtime.

=== Plugins Package

Contains outer layers such as optimization, persistence, routing and web.

== Dependency rules

Compile-time dependencies are only allowed in the direction from outer layers
towards the center.
This means plugins -> services -> domain.

The domain has no dependencies.

Services only depend on the domain.
If a service needs to send a result (e.g. to a database or web socket),
it uses an output boundary interface.
Its implementation is injected by the IoC container.

Plugins depend on services in two ways.
Firstly, they invoke services based on events such as a user input
or a route update coming from the optimization engine.
Services are injected into plugins, which moves the burden of their
construction and dependency resolution to the IoC container.
Secondly, plugins implement services' output boundary interfaces to handle
use case results, e.g. persisting changes to database, sending response to web UI.
