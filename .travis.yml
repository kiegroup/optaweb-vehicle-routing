# Change Travis install phase to only resolve dependencies needed to run the build.
# Otherwise it would run `mvn install`, which results in doing some Maven phases twice (validate, compile, jar, ...).

#
# We also want to prevent Maven's install phase from writing to ~/.m2/repository, which is cached.
