= Welcome to OptaWeb Vehicle Routing

== Quick start

If you want to run the application without building it from source, go to `bin` directory and use the run script.
You only need Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

== Documentation

Read the complete documentation under `reference_manual` directory in HTML or PDF format.

== Build from source

The distribution contains complete project sources under the `sources` directory.
You can build the project with Maven.
If you want to start hacking on the distributed sources,
it might be a good idea to initialize a Git repository first so that you can keep track of your changes.
You can do that with

----
cd sources/
git init && git add . && git commit -m 'Initial commit'
----

Find out more in `sources/README.adoc` or in the documentation.

== Run on OpenShift

Build the project first.
Then deploy it to OpenShift using the `runOnOpenShift.sh` script under `sources` directory.
